This is where your description should go. Limit it to a paragraph or two. Consider adding a small example.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require drewroberts/media
```

Add the cloudinary disk to the filesystem config and set the environment variables for your Cloudinary account.

```php
// config/filesystem.php
return [
    ...
    'disks' => [
        ...
        'cloudinary' => [
            'driver' => 'cloudinary',
            'api_key' => env('CLOUDINARY_API_KEY'),
            'api_secret' => env('CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET'),
            'cloud_name' => env('CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME'),
        ]
    ]
];
```

The migrations will run from the package. You can extend the Models from the package if you need additional classes or functions added to them. 

#### Registering the Nova resources

If you would like to use the Nova resources included with this package, you need to register it manually in your `NovaServiceProvider` in the `boot` method.

```php
Nova::resources([
    \DrewRoberts\Media\Nova\Image::class,
    \DrewRoberts\Media\Nova\Tag::class,
    \DrewRoberts\Media\Nova\Video::class,
]);
```
